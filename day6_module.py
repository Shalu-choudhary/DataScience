# module:->  it is a file that with help to you to deal with the problem  
#ex-  there are time.py file and all time releted problem are write in this file then it is called module
# from this we can access and import a file into another file 
# import filename ---> execute

# print(a.square_find(2))
# # print(a.manager_id)
# # print(a.manager_pass)
# print(a.product2)
# print(a.product4)

#for access particular block of code/single line

# from a import product2,product3
# print(product2)
# print(product3)

# from a import *     # FOR access all
# print(product3)

# for nickname of the file or do short a name then we use as keyword
# import heeeeeeeeellllooo as a
# print (a. product3)

#quiz
# create file name with loic.py and second file is solve.py
# min,max ,sort() func without using sort fun these are inside the logic.py and perform on diff list and perform in solve.py
